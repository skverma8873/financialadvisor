# About Product
### What Business Problem it solves.
In todays word. People still rely on Google, Youtube or other Finanical Product aggregator to address their Financial Queries. 

* Google : Users have to perform multiple searches and  analyse those articles / blogs to infer on their Financial Question. Everything manually.

* Youtube : Users have to perform multiple searches and listen to the vlog, analyse and infer on their Financial Question. Everything again requires manual intervention.

* Financial Platform Aggregators : Users have to login and provide their personal contact number to register on their platform. Search the Product after understanding their Platform UI to get a search result. After getting the search result Users have to manually compare and infer which is the best financial instrument for their requirement and financial goal.


Our product addresses all these problems by providing a simple Conversational Agent UI, where in user can just ask their question and our Financial Advisor would get the data and present it. It would answer domain specific quesion. It would answer Product specific quesions, analyze and provide suggestions based on users questions.

Currently we are supporting Mutual Fund product on our Financial Advisor platform.
